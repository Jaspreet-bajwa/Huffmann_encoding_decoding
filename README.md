The project is aimed at implementing Huffman encoding and decoding process using priority queues. 

The project is divided in three steps:

1. Implementation of Huffman tree using Binary Heap, 4 way cache optimized heap and pairing heap 
and determining which is the best priority queue in terms of timings.

2. Determiningthebestdatastructure,implementHuffmanencodingusingthatwhich will generate two files â€“ 
compressed version of input file and code table.

3. After encoding, we need to decompress and decode the data which will take as input the output of step 2 
and generate decoded.txt.
